                <h3>Fullstack Developer</h3>
                <p>At the age of 19, I am embarking on my journey into the realm of development,
                    fueled by a longstanding fascination with understanding the intricacies of 
                    various systems—from cars and machines to computers and games. This curiosity came mainly
                    from games like Undertale, The Binding of Isaac and content creators like Michael Reeves,
                    Dani, Mark Rober, Victor Schiavon, Little Carlos which
                    has led me to delve deeper into programming, where I specialize in C and GML.
                    Additionally, I am adept at working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fluent in
                    English, I attribute my language proficiency to a childhood immersed in video
                    games from the age of 2, learning the language almost effortlessly. Beyond
                    English, I invest my free time in studying Japanese and French.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My ultimate aspiration is to contribute to the world 
                    of game development, a passion that has been ingrained
                    in me since childhood. Currently, I am engrossed in a
                    project titled "Hellish Nightmare." This undertaking
                    is a roguelike game akin to Hades, infused with a touch
                    of humor, irony, and inspiration drawn from "Dante's Inferno,
                    The Divine Comedy." The game features a floor-like inspired 
                    stage system, with each level serving a distinct purpose and 
                    contributing significantly to the overarching narrative.
                </p>

                        Our professional journey began during our college years, and since then, we have successfully worked together on several projects.
                        Notable among these ventures are the development of hand-tracking software utilizing webcam technology and the creation of the
                        Imaginaction website.
